List of files:

    hellocube_grid_mouse_texture.html - This is the only file, showscases lighting, mouse turning and zooming with the wheel, and the grids/height maps.

Awesome WebGL functions:
    I didn't use any WebGL functions that were out of the ordinary, but the it was fun to be able to manually rotate the image, and zoom with the mouse.

Extra credit:
    Not attempted.

Misc:
    This assignment wasn't too bad (for the parts I completed). I was unable to get the ambient light to work in a way that seemed right. Setting the ambient uniform
    to be [0.0, 2.0, 0.0] in drawScene() resulted in the entire object being green, which didn't seem right. Nonetheless, the lighting of the object does change as it
    moves, becoming darker in some directions, and lighter in the other directions.

    I did look up how to determine if mouse wheel up or down was used for the zooming, which said event.deltaY changes based on scroll direction 
    (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63043172/webgl-three-js-canvas-zoom-in-and-out-with-mousewheel). I used that logic to change the 
    distance from the object whenever the mouse wheel is wheeled.
