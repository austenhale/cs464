List of files:

    hellocube_hw5.html - The main file with all the code to create the solar system.
    [planetname.jpg/png] - a file that is used as a texture for the respective planet

Awesome WebGL functions:
    I didn't use any WebGL functions that were out of the ordinary.

Extra credit:
    I added all the planets since it wasn't much more work.

Misc:
    For the most part, this assignment went well. It did take some time to figure out how to do the multiple textures, but eventually I got it.

    I did have a few issues, such as: the planets aren't completely spheres and I couldn't figure out why, and due to the textures the browser crashes
    after running for a minute or so. Unfortunately I couldn't find a way to fix these issues. Another issue I had that isn't part of the requirements
    but is something I wanted to do was to make the planets start at different areas around the Sun. However, I could only make it where they
    started on different sides instead of all around, so I just opted to keep them all starting on one side.
