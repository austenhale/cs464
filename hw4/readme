Awesome WebGL functions:
    I found a function that could be used to calculate a noise texture here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4200224/random-noise-functions-for-glsl

Extra credit:
    Not attempted.

Misc:
    This assignment was a bit harder than the previous ones. I couldn't get all the options to work 100%, but 
    I feel like I got a good start to most of them. Phong shading doens't seem to work, and I don't
    believe that any of the lighting options are really correct, but they do change which is nice.
    The bump option doesn't work, as I wasn't entirely sure what to do for it.
