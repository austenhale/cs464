    Shader Coloring:
        This is done in hellocube_colors.html, showing three different color combinations, with pictures in
        green_shader.png, white_shader.png, and yellow_shadow.png

Awesome WebGL functions:
    I didn't use any WebGL functions that were out of the ordinary, but the rotate function to make the objects
    rotate was awesome to see for the first time, turning a static picture into a rotating image.

Extra credit:
    Not attempted.

Misc:
    This was a neat starting assignment. The parts I struggled with most was creating a different shape using the vertices and the texture mapping; 
    the different shape took awhile to get the right combination in order to make a shape that wasn't a box. As for the texture mapping, it became a lot
    easier when I realized that the code was already completed, I just had to get a live server running (in my case I used Visual Studio Code's live server
    extension) and once the server was running, the texture mapping finally worked. I didn't work with any other students, and I used the class textbook to
    help with the assignment.
